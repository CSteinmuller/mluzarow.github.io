            About Me
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            I'm an electrical engineer graduate from Purdue University. I've worked in
            electronics labs for about two years, doing everything from initial project
            design and debugging, to microcontroller programming, to project packaging
            manufacturing.
            My focus has always been on microcontroller programming, programming various
            drivers and designing the needed circuits. I have also found myself leading my
            team when the chance would arise, mostly do to necessity as many did not enjoy
            the extra work associated; however I liked it as it was a great way to bond with
            one's group as well as gave you a good view of your project with what was already
            done and what needed to be done.
